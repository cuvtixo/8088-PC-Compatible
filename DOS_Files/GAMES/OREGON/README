Dear Oregon Trail User,

Thank you for purchasing The Oregon Trail!  The following information was too
late to be included in the User's Guide.  Please take the time to read it
so that you can receive maximum enjoyment from your software package.


Computer Display
================
Oregon Trail will automatically detect the graphic capability of your
computer (CGA, EGA, or VGA).  On some computers, this automatic
detection may fail.  If this happens, you may correct the situation by
specifying a graphic mode when starting the program.  Simply type

	OREGON CGA

if your computer uses CGA or EGA graphics, or

	OREGON VGA

if your computer uses VGA or MCGA graphics or better.
