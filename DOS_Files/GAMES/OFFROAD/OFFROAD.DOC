                    MANUAL FOR OFFROAD.EXE

OFFROAD, the desert racing game, by Monte Variakojis of MONTSOFT,
is an exciting simulation of off-road racing. You control a
four-wheel-drive truck in a race across the desert.

The game has eight levels of play. As you complete one level you
gain access to the next. Each level has its own set of obstacles
and dangers.

Use the cursor keys and the space bar to control your 4WD vehicle
and to fire at obstacles. A list of the keys and their actions
appears when you start the program.
