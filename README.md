8088 PC XT Compatible
This is a repository for my 8088 PC XT Compatible project developed in 2021.

My BIOS files are early versions and are very primitive.

The best BIOS to use is located at https://gitlab.com/hakfoo1/v40-bios. This works on the V20 and V40 just fine. You will need one of the earlier version if you are using an actual 8088 processor. This is due to some 80186 code that was included. 

You will find the Keyboard fix under asm/small code. Add this to your autoexec.bat if your keyboard is not working after DOS boots up.
